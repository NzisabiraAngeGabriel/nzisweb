			 	<h1>ABOUT <br> NZIS-RESTAURENT</h1>
			 	
			  	<div class="card1">
			  		<p>The creation of NZIS-Restaurent was not easy as i thought before,I just saw 
			  		the city of Bujumbura and realized that it's inhabitants are youths,comparing
			  		to how the life of Bumbura is and noticed that eating out in Restaurent would
			  		be so difficult.</p>

					<p>I did deep analyis regarding to how many items given in those Restaurents are
					of the same looking mainly:Rice;Beans;Cassava or Maze bread;Sauce;Sweet potatoes;
					Patotoes;Spaghetti and Taro......</p>

					<p>Looking to that countries and noticed that they serve variable food.Then,i started
					to think of how to prepare wel differently to their prepation and charge it cheaper
					than them by that,they will be well fed and i will try to remised them about our 
					tradition. </p>


					<p>Another imapactful reason for NZIS-Restaurent creation is cleanness.dul to lack of
					money,the Restaurent owness did not take care of their houses : He or she server you 
					wherever she wanted;Uncclean water they used made me feel more sad,i did not think 
					whether it's a human being ot not?</p>

					<p >I thought of this idea when i was still sixteen years old just in second year post
					fondamental and been fullfiled in 2027.The first NZIS-Restaurent started in KAMENGE 
					surroundings.</p>

					<p id="resto-card">The motto of NZIS-Restaurent is <span> << HUMAN RIGHT IS RIHT FOOD >></span>.</p>

			  	<h1>ABOUT <br>NZIS-CATEEN</h1>

			  	<div class="card2">
			  		<p>The origine of it came from how learners were being of learness.Due to that fact,there
			  		are so many learners who fell sock thanks to little cleanness of the food that they look.
			  		On top of that,governement and journalists tried to for bid the providers of those food 
			  		but nothing worked out becouse nouthere else students could get others except to those 
			  		providers</p>
					  
	  
			  		<p>There fore,i thought of this idea when i was longer in second year post fundamental as
			  		long as i was seventeen years old. For that reason,my dream became true as i approached
			  		twenty years old. NZIS-Canteen,for it's first stand,started from Municipal Lycee of CARAMA-2.</p>

			  		<p id="resto-card">The motto of NZIS-Canteen is <span><< CLEANNES,IT'S BEING UP-TO-DATE >>.</span> </p>
